# Specification Quality Checklist: Brainstorm Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Spec was derived from a brainstorm session with explicit user decisions on: directory location (project root), content format (structured summary), timing (end of session), overview structure (index plus active threads), incomplete session handling (ask user), numbering (sequential with topic slug), and revisit behavior (ask user).
